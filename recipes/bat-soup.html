    <h1>Bat Soup</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Bat soup is eaten in many countries in South-East Asia and Oceania, primarily in Indonesia (North Sulawesi) and the island nation of Palau.
    </p>
    <p>
        The soup has gotten immense coverage in 2020, when bats were mistakenly linked to the coronavirus outbreak. A film with people eating bat soup in Palau was wrongly labelled as being filmed in Wuhan and that was all that was needed for it to become viral and to start the fake news frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bats can transmit many viruses to humans, according to a few scientific reports, but there is no evidence to date that bats or bat soup was responsible for the novel coronavirus.
